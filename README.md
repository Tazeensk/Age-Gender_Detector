# Age-Gender_Detector
The project consists of a machine learning model trained on a specific dataset, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between facial characteristics and age/gender labels.
## To simply run this model:
1.Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2.Execute the gui.py file to launch the graphical user interface.
3.Upload the image that you want to analyze for age and gender detection.
4.Click on the "Detect" button to initiate the analysis process.
5.Once the analysis is complete, review the results displayed on the interface.
6.By following these steps, you can easily utilize the machine learning model to determine the age and gender of individuals in the uploaded images.
## To Run this Model yourself:
1.Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the provided link.
2.Download the dataset from the specified location.
3.Extract the dataset files into the folder where your repository is located.
4.Open the Jupyter Notebook named "Model" to access the machine learning model.
5.Execute the cells in the notebook by running it.
6.After running the notebook, proceed to run the gui.py file, which is responsible for the graphical user interface.
7.Upload the image that you want to analyze for age and gender detection using the provided interface.
8.Click on the "Detect" button to initiate the analysis process.
9.Review the results displayed on the interface to obtain insights into the detected age and gender of the individual in the uploaded image.
